EN_TEXT = """   The blockade quickly reduced the inhabitants to near starvation, and led many to flee the city. 
The restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, 
the violations of their customary rights, 
and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials led to the formation of a pro-surrender party within the city, 
which gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's metropolitan bishop, 
Symeon, encouraged his flock to resist. 
However, by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace on its own terms evident, 
a majority of the local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage that would accompany a 
forcible conquest. Venice's efforts to find allies against the Ottomans also failed: the other regional 
potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, 
or were defeated by the Ottomans.
    After years of inconclusive exchanges, the two sides prepared for a final confrontation in 1429. 
In March, Venice formally declared war on the Ottomans, 
but even then the conservative mercantile aristocracy running the 
Republic were uninterested in raising an army sufficient to protect Thessalonica, 
let alone to force the Sultan to seek terms. In early 1430, Murad was able to concentrate 
his forces against Thessalonica, taking it by storm on 29 March 1430. 
The privations of the siege and the subsequent sack reduced the city to a shadow of its former self, 
from perhaps as many as 40,000 inhabitants to c.â€‰2,000, and necessitated large-scale resettlement 
in the following years. Venice concluded a peace treaty with the Sultan in July, 
recognising the new status quo. Over the next few decades, the antagonism between 
Venice and the Ottomans morphed into a rivalry over control of Albania."""
